Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

/**
 * Solution for finding the search insert position in a sorted array.
 * Runtime: O(log n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
 */
class Solution {
    public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            // Use bitwise shift or subtraction to prevent integer overflow
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        // When the loop ends, 'left' is the correct insertion index
        return left;
    }
}
